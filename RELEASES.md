# Lemmy v0.16.3 Release (2022-04-08)

## What is Lemmy?

Lemmy is a self-hosted social link aggregation and discussion platform. It is completely free and open, and not controlled by any company. This means that there is no advertising, tracking, or secret algorithms. Content is organized into communities, so it is easy to subscribe to topics that you are interested in, and ignore others. Voting is used to bring the most interesting items to the top.

## Major Changes

A full list of fixes is below, but this patch release includes federation compatibility and bug fixes, as well as fixing vulnerabilities in our websocket rate limiting.

## Upgrade notes

Besides the addition of a [search rate limit to the lemmy.hjson](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L39), there are no config or API changes.

Follow the [Docker or Ansible upgrade instructions here.](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/administration.html)

## Support development

We (@dessalines and @nutomic) have been working full-time on Lemmy for almost two years. This is largely thanks to support from [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/). If you would like to support our efforts, please consider [donating](https://join-lemmy.org/donate).

If you'd like to support development, and make sure that we will always be available to work full time on Lemmy, consider [donating to support its development](https://join-lemmy.org/donate). We've spent hundreds of hours on Lemmy, and would like to be able to add more developers to our little open-source co-op as time goes on.

# Lemmy v0.16.0 Release: Theming and Federation improvements (2022-03-08)

## What is Lemmy?

Lemmy is a self-hosted social link aggregation and discussion platform. It is completely free and open, and not controlled by any company. This means that there is no advertising, tracking, or secret algorithms. Content is organized into communities, so it is easy to subscribe to topics that you are interested in, and ignore others. Voting is used to bring the most interesting items to the top.

## Major Changes

### Theming

Customizing Lemmy is now much easier than before. Instance admins can select a default instance theme under `/admin` which applies to all users who are not logged in, and those who haven't explicitly picked a theme.

It is also possible now to add custom themes to an instance, without having to recompile lemmy-ui. When running with Docker, make sure that [these lines](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ansible/pull/24/files) are present in docker-compose.yml (Ansible will add them automatically if you updated the repo). Then put your .css file into `./volumes/lemmy-ui/extra_themes`. The new theme can then be selected by users, or set as instance default.

For native installation (without Docker), themes are loaded by lemmy-ui from `./extra_themes` folder. A different path can be specified with `LEMMY_UI_EXTRA_THEMES_FOLDER` environment variable.

For instructions how to create a new theme, have a look at the [documentation](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/client_development/theming.html).

### Federation

@nutomic made many changes to federation to increase compatibility with other software. Lemmy can now receive deletions from [Pleroma], comments from [Friendica] and communities from [lotide](https://sr.ht/~vpzom/lotide/). Other actions were already compatible before. Mastodon can now display communities even when a user with identical name exists (but the user can't be viewed in that case). There were no breaking changes necessary, so federation is fully compatible with 0.15. If you notice something in another project that doesn't federate but should, please open an issue.

Multiple users have pointed out that posts, comments and votes don't federate reliably. We first attempted to fix this in [Lemmy 0.15.4](https://lemmy.ml/post/184152) a few days ago, but that didn't help much. Later @nutomic noticed that Lemmy was only sending out activities with 4 worker threads, which is not enough for a big instance like lemmy.ml. At the same time, many of those workers were taken up by sending to broken instances, trying to connect for a minute or more. This version adds a timeout and increases the number of workers.

### Federated bans

Until now, only community bans were federated, and the "Remove content" option didn't work over federation. The new version fixes this behaviour, so that both site bans and community bans federate, including "Remove content" option and expiry. Note that this change only affects new bans, those which were issued before upgrading to 0.16 will not be federated.

### Hide communities

@dayinjing implemented a funcionality for instance admins to hide controversial communities. A hidden community is only visible to those users who subscribe to it. This represents a milder alternative to removing a community. This functionality is not implemented in lemmy-ui yet, but admins can hide a community like this via command line:
```
curl -X PUT https://example.com/api/v3/community/hide \   
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d \
    '{"community_id":3,"hidden":true,"reason":"*reason for mod log*","auth":"*admin jwt token*"}'
```

### Jerboa: a new android app

To help adoption, and since most people use social media through their smartphones nowadays, @dessalines has been working on a native android app for Lemmy called [Jerboa](https://github.com/dessalines/jerboa), which is now on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.jerboa) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jerboa). 

It is still at an alpha level, but is very usable. We'd love to have experienced android developers contribute to it.

This now makes three smartphone apps for Lemmy: [Lemmur and Jerboa for Android, and Remmel for iOS](https://join-lemmy.org/apps). 


## Upgrade notes

Follow the [Docker or Ansible upgrade instructions here.](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/administration.html)

# Lemmy v0.15.1 Release (2022-01-12)

Lemmy now has private instances, optional registration applications, optional email verification, and temporary bans! These are described in detail below.

Special thanks to @asonix for adding [tokio-console](https://github.com/LemmyNet/Lemmy/issues/2003) and [Jaeger + opentelemetry](https://github.com/LemmyNet/Lemmy/issues/1992) to our dev setups, so we can better identify performance bottlenecks.


## What is Lemmy?

[Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) is similar to sites like Reddit, Lobste.rs, or Hacker News: you subscribe to communities you're interested in, post links and discussions, then vote and comment on them. Lemmy isn't just a reddit alternative; its a network of interconnected communities ran by different people and organizations, all combining to create a single, personalized front page of your favorite news, articles, and memes.

## Major Changes

### Required email verification

Admins can turn this on, and new users will need to verify their emails. Current users will not have to do this.

### Registration applications

Admins can now optionally make new users fill out an application to join your server. There is a new panel in their top bar where they can approve or deny pending applications.

This works in conjunction with the *require_email* field. If that is also turned on, the application will only be shown after their email has been verified. The user will receive an email when they have been accepted.

### Closed / Private instances

The instance settings now includes a *private instance* option, which if turned on, will only let logged in users view your site. Private instances was one of our first issues, and it was a large effort, so its great to finally have this completed.

### Temporary Bans

When banning users from your site or community, moderators can now optionally give a number of days for the ban to last.

### Allow comment replies from blocked users

It used to be that if a user blocked you, you couldn't respond to their public posts and comments. This is now fixed. They won't see your content, but others can.

## Upgrade notes

Follow the [Docker or Ansible upgrade instructions here.](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/administration.html)

## Support development

If you'd like to support development, and make sure that we will always be available to work full time on Lemmy, consider [donating to support its development](https://join-lemmy.org/donate). We've spent hundreds of hours on Lemmy, and would like to be able to add more developers to our little open-source co-op as time goes on.

## Changes

### API

We've removed a list of banned users from `GetSite`, added a few endpoints related to registration applications, made a few changes allowing temporary bans, site settings, made a few changes to the login response. These are non-destructive and current clients should work with this release. 

- A full list of the API changes can be seen on this diff of [lemmy-js-client: 0.14.0 -> 0.15.0](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client/compare/0.14.0-rc.1...0.15.0-rc.34) .

### Config

There is a new rate limit for creating new comments in the [config.hjson](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L36).

# Lemmy Release v0.14.0: Federation with Mastodon and Pleroma (2021-11-17)

Today is an exciting day for the Lemmy project.

Almost one year after [first enabling federation](https://lemmy.ml/post/42833), we now federate with other projects for the first time! According to some people's definition, this finally makes us part of the Fediverse.

It took a lot of work to make this possible, so big thanks to [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) for funding our full time work on Lemmy, and to [@lanodan](https://queer.hacktivis.me/users/lanodan) and [@asonix](https://masto.asonix.dog/@asonix) for helping to figure out how Pleroma and Mastodon federation works (it's difficult because they have almost no documentation).


## Major Changes

### Federation code rewrite

The rewrite of the federation code started by @nutomic in August is now mostly complete. As a result, the code is much cleaner, and has tests to guarantee no breaking changes between Lemmy versions. As a side effect of this rewrite, it was now relatively easy to enable federation with other projects. 

Mastodon and Pleroma users can:

- View Lemmy communities, user profiles, posts and comments
- Follow Lemmy communities to receive new posts and comments
- Replies (mentions) work in both directions, including notifications

In addition, Pleroma users can exchange private messages with Lemmy users.

Note that Pleroma and Mastodon rely on a compatibility mode in Lemmy, which means that they won't receive events like Deletes or Votes. Other projects whose federation works similar to Pleroma/Mastodon  will likely also federate.

### Hardcoded slur filter removed

Lemmy finally has essential moderation tools (reporting, user/community blocking), so the hardcoded filter isn't necessary anymore. If you want to keep using the slur filter, copy [these lines](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/b18ea3e0cc620c3f97f9804c09b92f193809b846/config/config.hjson#L8-L12) to your config file when upgrading, and adjust to your liking.

## Upgrade notes

Federation with Pleroma/Mastodon works automatically, you don't need to change anything, assuming that your allowlist/blocklist configuration permits it.

Note that Mastodon and Pleroma are much, much bigger than Lemmy at this point, with a combined 3 milion users and 4500 instances, compared to 20.000 users and 35 instances for Lemmy ([source](https://the-federation.info/)). The existing mod tools in Lemmy might not be adequate to handle that at the moment.

Be aware that if you have federation enabled in the Lemmy config, Mastodon and Pleroma users can now fetch all posts and comments, to view them and share with their followers. The Lemmy blocklist/allowlist can not prevent this, it only prevents posts/comments from blocked instances to be shown on your own instance. The only solution to this problem is disabling federation, or waiting for [signed fetch](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/868) to be implemented.

If you want to use federation, but review new instances before federating with them, use the allowlist. You can switch from open federation to allowlist federation by pasting the output of the command below into `federation.allowed_instances` in the Lemmy config.

```
curl https://your-instance.com/api/v3/site | jq -c .federated_instances.linked
```

The [`lemmy.hjson` `additional_slurs` field has changed its name to `slur_filter`. ](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/b18ea3e0cc620c3f97f9804c09b92f193809b846/config/config.hjson#L8-L12)

Follow the [Docker or Ansible upgrade instructions here.](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/administration.html)

## Lemmy-Ansible

We've now separated our ansible install method (the preferred way to deploy Lemmy) into its own repo, [lemmy-ansible](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ansible). Let us know if you need help migrating existing installations over to it.

## Changes

### API

- There is now a `GetUnreadCount` in the API to check the count of your unread messages, replies, and mentions.
- A full list of the API changes can be seen on this diff of [lemmy-js-client: 0.13.0 -> 0.14.0-rc.1](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client/compare/0.13.0...0.14.0-rc.1) .

## Changes

Since our last release in February, we've had [~150](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/0.9.9...main) commits to Lemmy. The biggest changes, as we'll outline below, are a split of Lemmy's user tables into federated and local tables, necessitating a `v3` of Lemmy's API, federated moderation, i18n support in join-lemmy.org, and lots of back-end cleanup.

### Lemmy Server

#### General

- Rewrote config implementation, finally allowing us to use newer Rust versions.
- Removed categories. 
- Various refactors.

#### API

- A full list of the API changes can be seen on this diff of [lemmy-js-client: 0.9.9 -> 0.10.0](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client/compare/0.9.9...0.10.0-rc.13) .
- Login invalidation on password change, thanks to @Mart-Bogdan

#### Federation

- It is now possible to add users from other instances as community mods.
- Federating Matrix ID.
- Many changes for better compatibility with ActivityPub standard.

#### Database 

- Split the `user_` into `person` and `local_user` tables.
- Strictly typed commonly used ID columns, to prevent DB errors using `i32` as ids.
- Strictly typed URL fields, thanks to ajyoon.
- Created default DB forms, now used in all the unit tests.

### Lemmy UI

- Now using utf-8 emojis.
- Support for all the above changes to Lemmy.
- Typescript-safe i18n strings, thanks to @shilangyu.
- Added expandable post text (click on open book icon).
- Prettier cross-posting, which does smart quoting.
- Bugfixes for restoring scroll position on post page, custom site favicons, and autocomplete for login fields.

### Lemmy Docs

- Gazconroy built an [Async API spec for Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/api/index.html), that now serves as our main API docs.

### join-lemmy.org

- Rewrote in inferno isomorphic, added i18n support via [weblate](https://weblate.yerbamate.ml/projects/lemmy/joinlemmy/).
- Added a section on the support page thanking contributors.
- Changed some page urls / titles

## Upgrade notes

**Important**: there are multiple breaking changes:

- Configuration via environment variables is not supported anymore, you must have all your config in the [lemmy.hjson](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/ansible/templates/config.hjson) file ( except for `LEMMY_CONFIG_LOCATION` ).
- The config format for `allowed_instances` and `blocked_instances` has changed, and you need to adjust your config file manually:
    - before: `allowed_instances: ds9.lemmy.ml,enterprise.lemmy.ml`
    - now: `allowed_instances: ["ds9.lemmy.ml", "enterprise.lemmy.ml"]` , and only one of the `allowed_instances` or `blocked_instances` blocks can be set.
- The API has been upgraded from `v2` to `v3`, so all clients need to be updated: [lemmy-js-client: 0.9.9 -> 0.10.0](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client/compare/0.9.9...0.10.0-rc.13) .

If you'd like to make a DB backup before upgrading, follow [this guide](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/backup_and_restore.html).

To upgrade your instance to `v0.10.0`, simply follow the instructions in the documentation:

- [Upgrade with manual Docker installation](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_docker.html#updating)
- [Upgrade with Ansible installation](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/administration/install_ansible.html)


## Compilation time

|| v0.9.0 (Rust 1.47) | v0.10.0 (Rust 1.47) | v0.10.0 (Rust 1.51) |
|-| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Clean | 140s     | 146s     | 119s     |
| Incremental | 28s | 22s | 19s |

Despite ongoing efforts to speed up compilation, it has actually gotten slower when comparing with the same Rust version. Only thanks to improvements in newer Rust versions has our build process gotten faster. This could be simply because we added more code, while Lemmy v0.9.0 had 22.4k lines of Rust, v0.10.0 has 23.8k (an increase of 6%).

v0.9.0 build graph:
![](https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/GVBqFnrLqG.jpg)

v0.10.0 build graph:
![](https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/NllzjVEyNK.jpg)

We extracted the crates `lemmy_api_crud` and `lemmy_apub_receive` from `lemmy_api` and `lemmy_apub`, respectively, and renamed `lemmy_structs` to `lemmy_api_common`. In the second graph you can see how parts of the api and apub crates are now built nicely in parallel, speeding up builds on multi-core systems.

On the other hand, some crates have gotten much slower to compile, in particular `lemmy_db_queries` (6.5s slower), `lemmy_apub` (6.5s slower if we include `lemmy_apub_receive`). And `lemmy_db_views` is quite slow, just as before.

Since our last release in October of last year, and we've had [~450](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.8.0...main) commits.

The biggest changes, as we'll outline below, are a re-work of Lemmy's database structure, a `v2` of Lemmy's API, and activitypub compliance fixes. The new re-worked DB is much faster, easier to maintain, and [now supports hierarchical rather than flat objects in the new API](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1275).

We've also seen the first release of [Lemmur](https://github.com/LemmurOrg/lemmur/releases/tag/v0.1.1), an android / iOS (soon) / windows / linux client, as well as [Lemmer](https://github.com/uuttff8/Lemmy-iOS), a native iOS client. Much thanks to @krawieck, @shilangyu, and @uuttff8 for making these great clients. If you can, please contribute to their [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/lemmur) to help fund lemmur development.

## LemmyNet projects

### Lemmy Server

- [Moved views from SQL to Diesel](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1275). This was a spinal replacement for much of lemmy.
  - Removed all the old fast_tables and triggers, and created new aggregates tables.
- Added a `v2` of the API to support the hierarchical objects created from the above changes.
- Moved continuous integration to [drone](https://cloud.drone.io/LemmyNet/lemmy/), now includes formatting, clippy, and cargo build checks, unit testing, and federation testing. [Drone also deploys both amd64 and arm64 images to dockerhub.](https://hub.docker.com/r/dessalines/lemmy)
- Split out documentation into git submodule.
- Shortened slur filter to avoid false positives.
- Added query performance testing and comparisons. Added indexes to make sure every query is `< 30 ms`.
- Added compilation time testing.

### Federation

This release includes some bug fixes for federation, and some changes to get us closer to compliance with the ActivityPub standard.

- [Community bans now federating](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1287).
- [Local posts sometimes got marked as remote](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1302).
- [Creator of post/comment was not notified about new child comments](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1325).
- [Community deletion now federated](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/1256).

None of these are breaking changes, so federation between 0.9.0 and 0.8.11 will work without problems.

### Lemmy javascript / typescript client

- Updated the [lemmy-js-client](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client) to use the new `v2` API. Our API docs now reference this project's files, to show what the http / websocket forms and responses should look like.
- Drone now handles publishing its [npm packages.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lemmy-js-client)

### Lemmy-UI

- Updated it to use the `v2` API via `lemmy-js-client`, required changing nearly every component.
- Added a live comment count.
- Added drone deploying, and builds for ARM.
- Fixed community link wrapping.
- Various other bug fixes.


### Lemmy Docs

- We moved documentation into a separate git repository, and support translation for the docs now!
- Moved our code of conduct into the documentation.

# Lemmy v0.8.0 Release (2020-10-16)

## Changes

We've been working at warp speed since our `v0.7.0` release in June, adding over [870 commits](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.7.0...main) since then. :sweat: 

Here are some of the bigger changes:

### LemmyNet projects

- Created [LemmyNet](https://github.com/LemmyNet), where all lemmy-related projects live.
- Split out the frontend into a separete repository, [lemmy-ui](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui)
- Created a [lemmy-js-client](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client), for any js / typescript developers.
- Split out i18n [lemmy-translations](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-translations), that any app or site developers can import and use. Lemmy currently supports [~30 languages!](https://weblate.yerbamate.ml/projects/lemmy/lemmy/)

### Lemmy Server

#### Federation

- The first **federation public beta release**, woohoo :fireworks: 
- All Lemmy functionality now works over ActivityPub (except turning remote users into mods/admins)
- Instance allowlist and blocklist
- Documentation for [admins](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/administration_federation.html) and [devs](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/contributing_federation_overview.html) on how federation works
- Upgraded to newest versions of @asonix activitypub libraries
- Full local federation setup for manual testing
- Automated testing for nearly every federation action
- Many additional security checks
- Lots and lots of refactoring
- Asynchronous sending of outgoing activities

### User Interface

- Separated the UI from the server code, in [lemmy-ui](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui).
- The UI can now read with javascript disabled! 
- It's now a fully isomorphic application using [inferno-isomorphic](https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/isomorphic). This means that page loads are now much faster, as the server does the work.
- The UI now also supports open-graph and twitter cards! Linking to lemmy posts (from whatever platform you use) looks pretty now: ![](https://i.imgur.com/6TZ2v7s.png)
- Improved the search page ( more features incoming ).
- The default view is now `Local`, instead of `All`, since all would show all federated posts.
- User settings are now shared across browsers ( a page refresh will pick up changes ).
- A much leaner mobile view.

#### Backend

- Re-organized the rust codebase into separate workspaces for backend and frontend.
- Removed materialized views, making the database **a lot faster**.
- New post sorts `Active` (previously called hot), and `Hot`. Active shows posts with recent comments, hot shows highly ranked posts.
- New sort for `Local` ( meaning from local communities).
- Customizeable site, user, and community icons and banners.
- Added user preferred names / display names, bios, and cakedays.
- Visual / Audio captchas through the lemmy API.
- Lots of API field verifications.
- Upgraded to pictrs-v2 ( thanks to @asonix )
- Wayyy too many bugfixes to count.

## Contributors

We'd also like to thank both the [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) for their support in allowing us to work full-time on Lemmy ( as well as their support for [other important open-source projects](https://nlnet.nl/project/current.html) ), [those who sponsor us](https://lemmy.ml/sponsors), and those who [help translate Lemmy](https://weblate.yerbamate.ml/projects/lemmy/). Every little bit does help. We remain committed to never allowing advertisements, monetizing, or venture-capital in Lemmy; software should be communal, and should benefit humanity, not a small group of company owners. 

## Upgrading

- [with manual Docker installation](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/administration_install_docker.html#updating)
- [with Ansible installation](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/administration_install_ansible.html)

## Testing Federation

Federation is finally ready in Lemmy, pending possible bugs or other issues. So for now we suggest to enable federation only on test servers, or try it on our own test servers ( [enterprise](https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/), [ds9](https://ds9.lemmy.ml/), [voyager](https://voyager.lemmy.ml/) ).

If everything goes well, after a few weeks we will enable federation on lemmy.ml, at first with a limited number of trusted instances. We will also likely change the domain to https://lemmy.ml . Keep in mind that changing domains after turning on federation will break things.

To enable on your instance, edit your [lemmy.hjson](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L60) federation section to `enabled: true`, and restart.

### Connecting to another server

The server https://ds9.lemmy.ml has open federation, so after either adding it to the `allowed_instances` list in your `config.hjson`, or if you have open federation, you don't need to add it explicitly.

To federate / connect with a server, type in `!community_name@server.tld`, in your server's search box [like so](https://voyager.lemmy.ml/search/q/!main%40ds9.lemmy.ml/type/All/sort/TopAll/page/1).

To connect with the `main` community on ds9, the search is `!main@ds9.lemmy.ml`.

You can then click the community, and you will see a local version of the community, which you can subscribe to. New posts and comments from `!main@ds9.lemmy.ml` will now show up on your front page, or `/c/All`

# Lemmy v0.7.40 Pre-Release (2020-08-05)

We've [added a lot](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.7.40...v0.7.0) in this pre-release:

- New post sorts `Active` (previously called hot), and `Hot`. Active shows posts with recent comments, hot shows highly ranked posts.
- Customizeable site icon and banner, user icon and banner, and community icon and banner.
- Added user preferred names / display names, bios, and cakedays.
- User settings are now shared across browsers (a page refresh will pick up changes).
- Visual / Audio captchas through the lemmy API.
- Lots of UI prettiness.
- Lots of bug fixes.
- Lots of additional translations.
- Lots of federation prepping / additions / refactors.

for backup instructions.

**With Ansible:**

```
# deploy with ansible from your local lemmy git repo
git pull
cd ansible
ansible-playbook lemmy.yml
# connect via ssh to run the migration script
ssh your-server
cd /lemmy/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/master/docker/prod/migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
chmod +x migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
sudo ./migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
```

**With manual Docker installation:**
```
# run these commands on your server
cd /lemmy
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/master/ansible/templates/nginx.conf
# Replace the {{ vars }}
sudo mv nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/lemmy.conf
sudo nginx -s reload
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/master/docker/prod/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/master/docker/prod/migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
chmod +x migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
sudo bash migrate-pictshare-to-pictrs.bash
```

**Note:** After upgrading, all users need to reload the page, then logout and
login again, so that images are loaded correctly.

# Lemmy v0.6.0 Release (2020-01-16)

`v0.6.0` is here, and we've closed [41 issues!](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/milestone/15?closed=1) 

This is the biggest release by far:

- Avatars!

- Ability to change your password and email address.
- Can set a custom language.
- Lemmy-wide settings to disable downvotes, and close registration.
- A better documentation system, hosted in lemmy itself.
- [Huge DB performance gains](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/411) (everthing down to < `30ms`) by using materialized views. 
- Fixed major issue with similar post URL and title searching.
- Upgraded to Actix `2.0`
- Faster comment / post voting.

# PostgreSQL concurrency

Self-awareness of overloaded PostgreSQL during peak activity periods....

Lemmy can support budget-orinted operatrs and some degrdation may be preferable to absolute errors.

1. Turn off account-specific blocking of communities, persons, etc
2. Turn off saved, read and other account-specific lookups
3. Turn off sort orders "Old", anything greater than 3 months
4. Logged-in account INSERT actions throttle back per-login

Right now there are hard-coded 24x7 throttles geared for performance. 300 posts, 50 on community list, etc.

Work In Progress, messy doc, needs more work. Got interrupted ;)

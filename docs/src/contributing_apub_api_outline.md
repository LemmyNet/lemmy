# Activitypub API outline

This document is targeted at developers who are familiar with the ActivityPub and ActivityStreams protocols. It gives a detailed outline of the actors, objects and activities used by Lemmy.

Before reading this, have a look at our [Federation Overview](contributing_federation_overview.md) to get an idea how Lemmy federation works on a high level.

Lemmy does not yet follow the ActivityPub spec in all regards. For example, we don't set a valid context indicating our context fields. We also ignore fields like `inbox`, `outbox` or `endpoints` for remote actors, and assume that everything is Lemmy. For an overview of deviations, read [#698](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/698). They will be fixed in the near future.

Lemmy is also really inflexible when it comes to incoming activities and objects. They need to be exactly identical to the examples below. Things like having an array instead of a single value, or an object ID instead of the full object will result in an error.

In the following tables, "mandatory" refers to whether or not Lemmy will accept an incoming activity without this field. Lemmy itself will always include all non-empty fields.

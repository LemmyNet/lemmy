## Architecture

### Front end

- The front end is written in `typescript`, using a react-like framework called [inferno](https://infernojs.org/). All UI elements are reusable `.tsx` components.
- The front end repository is [lemmy-ui](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui).
- The routes are at `src/shared/routes.ts`.
- The components are located in `src/shared/components`.

### Back end

- The back end is written in `rust`, using `diesel`, and `actix`.
- The server source code is split into main sections in `src`. These include: 
  - `db` - The low level database actions.
    - Database additions are done using diesel migrations. Run `diesel migration generate xxxxx` to add new things.
  - `api` - The high level user interactions (things like `CreateComment`)
  - `routes` - The server endpoints .
  - `apub` - The activitypub conversions.
  - `websocket` - Creates the websocket server. 

## Linting / Formatting

- Every front and back end commit is automatically formatted then linted using `husky`, and `lint-staged`.
- Rust with `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
- Typescript with `prettier` and `eslint`.

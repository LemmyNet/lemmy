-- A trigger is associated with a table instead of a schema, so they can't be in the `r` schema. This is
-- okay if the function specified after `EXECUTE FUNCTION` is in `r`, since dropping the function drops the trigger.
--
-- Tables that are updated by triggers should not have foreign keys that aren't set to `INITIALLY DEFERRED`
-- (even if only other columns are updated) because triggers can run after the deletion of referenced rows and
-- before the automatic deletion of the row that references it. This is not a problem for insert or delete.
--
-- Triggers that update multiple tables should use this order: person_aggregates, comment_aggregates,
-- post_aggregates, community_aggregates, site_aggregates
--   * The order matters because the updated rows are locked until the end of the transaction, and statements
--     in a trigger don't use separate transactions. This means that updates closer to the beginning cause
--     longer locks because the duration of each update extends the durations of the locks caused by previous
--     updates. Long locks are worse on rows that have more concurrent transactions trying to update them. The
--     listed order starts with tables that are less likely to have such rows.
--     https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/transaction-iso.html#XACT-READ-COMMITTED
--   * Using the same order in every trigger matters because a deadlock is possible if multiple transactions
--     update the same rows in a different order.
--     https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-DEADLOCKS

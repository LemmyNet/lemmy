/// Activities are sent to the community itself if it lives on another instance. If the community
/// is local, the activity is directly wrapped into Announce and sent to community followers.
/// Activities are also sent to those who follow the actor (with exception of moderation activities).
///
/// * `activity` - The activity which is being sent
/// * `actor` - The user who is sending the activity
/// * `community` - Community inside which the activity is sent
/// * `inboxes` - Any additional inboxes the activity should be sent to (for example,
///               to the user who is being promoted to moderator)
/// * `is_mod_activity` - True for things like Add/Mod, these are not sent to user followers

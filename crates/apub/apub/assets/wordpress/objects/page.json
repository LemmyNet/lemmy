  "content": "<p>I recently got my hands on a 3D printer and have been slowly enhancing and customizing my board game collection through printing new insertsand replacing components (typically wooden cubes, or cardboard tokens) with 3D printed version of them<sup><a href=\"#9171b805-3e14-40f7-9061-1583b24368c3\">1</a></sup>.</p><p>When I reached the time to do my <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/315727/last-light\">Last Light</a> board game I initially just printed some planet/extractors supports and called it a day. However after I finished with my improvements for <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/359871/arcs\">Arcs</a>, where I replaced the basic spaceships with 3D printed custom versions,I got the idea to do the same for Last Light. Unfortunately, unlike Arcs I couldn&#8217;t find any spaceships someone else prepared for it, so I continued with other projects until as part of these projects I discovered a new workflow.</p><p>You see, there are GenAI models which can generate full 3D models from an existing image. They&#8217;re not as great with any random image, but if you feed them something specifically looking like a 3D model, they can be very good. I also have access to Generative AI through the <a href=\"https://aihorde.net/\">AI Horde</a> and can generate any number of images for it through local compute (mostly mine), and recently a new very powerful model was added to it<sup><a href=\"#06101c1f-78af-44ab-ac66-3b4e086ac40f\">2</a></sup>. Finally an AI Horde LLM can be used to take the core idea for a conceptand expand/brainstorm on it to improve its look.</p><p>My first test for this was printing a large Gargoyle as a gift. As I couldn&#8217;t find one in the shape or design I wanted, I just generated one myself. This was also my first proof-of-concept for how this workload could work and I was frankly blown away when I finished printing the model. The results were significantly better quality than I expected! As soon as I saw that, I knew my next project would be to see if I can generate 3 ship types for each color in Last Light. And, friends, let&#8217;s just say I might have gotten a bit carried away&#8230;</p><h2>My Epic Last Light Custom Ship Expansion</h2><p>Initially I generated only one fleet per color. Each fleet includes one large/dreadnought, one medium/frigate and one small/fighter spaceship. The small ships are are designed to look maneuverable, while the dreadnoughts to look imposing. Once I did the primary colors, Ithought to myself, &#8220;What if someone picks a color, but doesn&#8217;t like the design of the ships for that color. And also, why even limit myself? Youknow what, I&#8217;m gonna make <strong>two</strong> designs per color&#8221;. Honestly I was having way too much time making these designs and on the second wave of, I decided to be even more creative with the options.</p><p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s see the results. I&#8217;ll separate the headings below for each of the primary colors of Last Light, and the two options I designed for it. Each color has one design for the primary color, and one for an off-color of some way. For example White and Silver, Blue and Cyan and so on, so as to have each off-color clearly belong to one of the primary colors in the game. For each color, you can find a download link to the models and more pictures on Makeworld in the image caption.</p><div><div><h2>Black</h2><div><div><div><figure><img width=\"696\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Splash-Art.jpg?resize=696%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption><strong><a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en/models/2080011-last-light-spaceships-black-theme\">Black: Shadows</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>For this design, I wanted to make something that is all sharp pointy edges and malicious force. Interesting tidbit, the Frigate was the first ship I printed and it came up slightly too large compared to the original medium spaceship cardboard token. Second interesting tidbit, the fighter design originally belonged to the Grey designs (see below), but I decided that it&#8217;s better to make it part of the shadows as a cohesive whole, and modified its design prompt for the dreadnought.</p><figure><figure><img width=\"980\" height=\"980\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/small3-1.png?resize=980%2C980&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Black Fighter Design</figcaption></figure><figure><img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/small-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Black Fighter Print</figcaption></figure><figure><img width=\"704\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medium-1.png?resize=704%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Black Frigate Design</figcaption></figure><figure><img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/medium.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Black Frigate Print</figcaption></figure><figure><img width=\"980\" height=\"980\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/large-1.png?resize=980%2C980&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Black Dreadnought Design</figcaption></figure><figure><img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/large.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Black Dreadnought Print</figcaption></figure></figure></div></div><div><div><figure><img width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Splash-Art2-1.png?resize=683%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption><strong><a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en/models/2080011-last-light-spaceships-black-theme\">Grey: Geometric</a></strong></figcaption></figure><p>Of course I wished for a Borg-like brutalist design as a choice as well. The models you see below are actually hand-painted as I run out of grey filament. I had to do a few re-designs for the pyramid in order to appear that it has less of a base (since there&#8217;s no ground in space). I would have liked a spherical spaceship to complete this trio, but that doesn&#8217;t make for an easy miniature.

    "en": "<p>I recently got my hands on a 3D printer and have been slowly enhancing and customizing my board game collection through printing new inserts and replacing components (typically wooden cubes, or cardboard tokens) with 3D printed version of them<sup><a href=\"#9171b805-3e14-40f7-9061-1583b24368c3\">1</a></sup>.</p><p>When I reached the time to do my <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/315727/last-light\">Last Light</a> board game I initially just printed some planet/extractors supports and called it a day. However after I finished with my improvements for <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/359871/arcs\">Arcs</a>, where I replaced the basic spaceships with 3D printed custom versions,I got the idea to do the same for Last Light. Unfortunately, unlike Arcs I couldn&#8217;t find any spaceships someone else prepared for it, so I continued with other projects until as part of these projects I discovered a new workflow.</p><p>You see, there are GenAI models which can generate full 3D models from an existing image. They&#8217;re not as great with any random image, but if you feed them something specifically looking like a 3D model, they can be very good. I also have access to Generative AI through the <a href=\"https://aihorde.net/\">AI Horde</a> and can generate any number of images for it through local compute (mostly mine), and recently a new very powerful model was added to it<sup><a href=\"#06101c1f-78af-44ab-ac66-3b4e086ac40f\">2</a></sup>. Finally an AI Horde LLM can be used to take the core idea for a concept and expand/brainstorm on it to improve its look.</p><p>My first test for this was printing a large Gargoyle as a gift. As I couldn&#8217;t find one in the shape or design I wanted, I just generated one myself. This was also my first proof-of-concept for how this workload could work and I was frankly blown away whenI finished printing the model. The results were significantly better quality than I expected! As soon as I saw that, I knew my next project would be to see if I can generate 3 ship types for each color in Last Light. And, friends, let&#8217;s just say I might have gotten a bit carried away&#8230;</p><h2>My Epic Last Light Custom Ship Expansion</h2><p>Initially I generated only one fleet per color. Each fleet includes one large/dreadnought, one medium/frigate and onesmall/fighter spaceship. The small ships are are designed to look maneuverable, while the dreadnoughts to look imposing. Once I did the primary colors, I thought to myself, &#8220;What if someone picks a color, but doesn&#8217;t like the design of the ships for that color. And also, why even limit myself? You know what, I&#8217;m gonna make <strong>two</strong> designs per color&#8221;. Honestly I was having way too much time making these designs and on the second wave of, I decided to be even more creative with the options.</p><p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s see the results. I&#8217;ll separate the headings below for each of the primary colors of Last Light, and the two options I designed for it. Each color has one design for the primary color, and one for an off-color of some way. For example White and Silver, Blue and Cyan and so on, so as to have each off-color clearly belong to one of the primary colors in the game.For each color, you can find a download link to the models and more pictures on Makeworld in the image caption.</p><div><div><h2>Black</h2><div><div><div><figure><img width=\"696\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dbzer0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Splash-Art.jpg?resize=696%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><strong><a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en/models/2080011-last-light-spaceships-black-theme\">Black: Shadows</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>For this design, I wanted to make something that is all sharp pointy edges and malicious force.

-- prototype/draft, work in progress

-- meaning of the name "post/comment byebye and return"
--   post/comment can be deleted or removed or banned by community or community itself is banned or hidden = byebye
--   byebye actions can be reversed = return
--   post or comment present many of the same logic choices.

-- lemmy_server 0.18.2 context:
--   byebye actions are causing massive performance problems on the site. Individual deletes taking PostgreSQL many seconds.
--   byebye actions upon multiple posts and comments, such as account delete, are crashing the servers. Although
--   an emergency fix to site_aggregates may have improved the sitaution.


-- ASSUMPTIONS:
--    1. calling trigger already confirmed deleted OR removed field change
--    2. (clarified 1) ???
--    3. lemmy Rust code does not touch comments when a post is deleted/removed (or reverse of same)
--    4. this function is called only on UPDATE, not SQL DELETE statements. Heads up:
--          Because a DELETE would need to consider if it was previously deleted/removed and count decremented.
--    5. it is possible for both user delete and mod remove to happen to the same post
--       this means to consider not decrementing or incrementing twice for one actual post.
--    6. SET deleted = 't' SET removed = 't' do not come in on the same SQL UPDATE, they are unique
--           SQL UPDATE statements (and client API calls) within the Lemmy Rust code.
--    7. community_id of a post isn't being changed at same time, NEW is stable on this field
--    8. creator_id of a post isn't being changed at same time, NEW is stable on this field
--    9. an INSERT trigger would not be called to match this function because INSERT
--           of an already-deleted or already-removed post makes no sense?
